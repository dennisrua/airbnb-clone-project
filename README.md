# StayEase: AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack clone** of the popular accommodation booking platform **AirBnB**.  
The goal is to build a functional web application where users can browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings.

## Project Goals

- Implement responsive UI/UX designs
- Structure a complex web application
- Practice collaboration with defined team roles
- Develop reusable component-based frontend architecture
- Apply best practices in full-stack web development

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Design Tools:** Figma for UI/UX design

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Create an intuitive booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency across pages
- Ensure fast loading times
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness

### Key Features

- Property search and filtering
- Detailed property viewing
- Secure checkout process
- User authentication

### Primary Pages

| Page                      | Description                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Property Listing View** | Grid display of available properties with filters      |
